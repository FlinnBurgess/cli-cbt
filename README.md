This tool is based off of the book "Learned Optimism"
It's purpose is to train your mind to have a more positive explanatory style. What is meant by explanatory style is the way that you describe and explain events that happen around you.

## Installation
To start using the tool, clone the directory to your machine and then navigate to the folder in your terminal and run `./cli-cbt`

If you would like to be able to run the tool from anywhere then you will need to add the folder to your PATH variable, by updating .bashrc, .zshrc or whatever the relevant config file is for your environment.

By default your recordings are saved in the folder in which the script is kept, in the file records.txt. If you would like to save it in a different location or file, then edit the variable `records` inside the `cli-cbt` script.

## Usage
```
cli-cbt         - starts the process of recording a new thought or feeling
cli-cbt records - opens the file in which your records are saved
cli-cbt help    - lists these instructions
cli-cbt about   - provides the information below
```

## About
There are three main characteristics of explanatory style that differentiate optimists from pessimists:  
### Permanence: is the thing permanent or temporary?
Pessimists tend to think that bad things are permanent while good things are temporary

Pessimistic example (permanent): "skiing is difficult", "the boss is a bastard"  
Optimistic example: (temporary): "the trails were icy today", "the boss is in a bad mood"  
###Pervasiveness: Does your belief apply to everything or just this one specific example?
Pessimists tend to apply negative beliefs to everything in a category rather than specific instances

Pessimistic example (universal): "I'm repulsive", "All teachers are unfair"  
Optimistic example (specific): "I'm repulsive to him", "This particular teacher is unfair"
### Personalisation: Is the cause of the problem internal or external?
Pessimists tend to blame themselves for bad events

Pessimistic example (internal): "I have no talent in poker", "I'm stupid"  
Optimistic example (external): "I have no luck in poker", "You're stupid"

The tool uses CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) methods to help you change your explanatory style from negative to positive.
When you run the tool, it will ask you first for three things:

**Adversity**: What happened that you are now thinking about? (e.g. My child didn't do her homework)  
**Belief**: What are you beliefs about the adversity? (e.g. I am a bad parent)  
**Consequence**: What did you do or feel in response to these beliefs? (e.g. I felt like I had failed and felt sad for the rest of the day)

Next, it will walk you through some exercises which encourage you to challenge and dispute your thoughts:

**Evidence**: What evidence do you have against your beliefs? (e.g. I spend hours with my child every week teaching her sports and music, I'm not a bad parent)  
**Alternatives**: What are some alternative, less catastrophic explanations for the adversity? (e.g. I've been very busy at work this week so didn't have the time to check if my child had done her homework)  
**Implications**: Even if your belief is true, is it really the end of the world? Go back and look for evidence on the contrary. (e.g. Maybe I wasn't the best parent lately. But until recently I've done a really good job making sure she does her homework.)  
**Usefulness**: Is it worth ruminating about the thought at the moment? Sometimes there's nothing to be gained from keeping the thoughts in your mind. Consider writing the thought down to get it out of your head, or setting a time later in the day to think about it so that you can forget it for now.

The aim is that by giving you an easily accessible tool to guide you through recording your thoughts and feelings when you catch yourself thinking in these ways, you will begin to gradually change your patterns of thought and become more optimistic. I recommend reading the book "Learned Optimism" if you would like to learn about the many benefits of optimistic thinking.
